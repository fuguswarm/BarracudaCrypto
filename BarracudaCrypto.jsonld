My experience in data analytics, governance, and rooting for the underdog drives me to ensure that every voice is heard and every opportunity is fair, helping build a truly empowered community.",

I advocate for a governance structure where every voice matters, where everyone—regardless of their background, reputation, or resources—has a say in shaping the future. Decentralized governance is built on the idea that the wisdom of the crowd often produces better outcomes than the wisdom of the few. \n\n",
